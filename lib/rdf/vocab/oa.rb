The oa:FragmentSelector MUST have exactly 1 rdf:value property, containing the fragment identifier component of a URI that describes the segment of interest in the resource, excluding the initial "#".

This class is not used directly in Annotations, only its subclasses are.

The nature of the Selector will be dependent on the type of the representation for which the segment is conveyed. The specific type of selector should be indicated using a subclass of oa:Selector.

The Specifier's description MAY be conveyed as an external or embedded resource \(cnt:Content\), or as RDF properties within the graph. The description SHOULD use existing standards whenever possible.

It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use the URI of a document as a Semantic Tag, as it might also be used as a regular Body in other Annotations which would inherit the oa:SemanticTag class assignment.

    term :SpecificResource,
      comment: %(A resource identifies part of another Source resource, a particular representation of a resource, a resource with styling hints for renders, or any combination of these. 

The Specific Resource takes the role of oa:hasBody or oa:hasTarget in an oa:Annotation instead of the Source resource.

There MUST be exactly 1 oa:hasSource relationship associated with a Specific Resource.

There MUST be exactly 0 or 1 oa:hasSelector relationship associated with a Specific Resource.

There MAY be 0 or 1 oa:hasState relationship for each Specific Resource.

If the Specific Resource has an HTTP URI, then the exact segment of the Source resource that it identifies, and only the segment, MUST be returned when the URI is dereferenced. For example, if the segment of interest is a region of an image and the Specific Resource has an HTTP URI, then dereferencing it MUST return the selected region of the image as it was at the time when the annotation was created. Typically this would be a burden to support, and thus the Specific Resource SHOULD be identified by a globally unique URI, such as a UUID URN. If it is not considered important to allow other Annotations or systems to refer to the Specific Resource, then a blank node MAY be used instead.).freeze,

The content of the resource provides the rendering hints about the Annotation's constituent resources.

    term :SvgSelector,
      comment: %(A Selector which selects an area specified as an SVG shape.

The SVG document should either be retrievable by resolving the URI of this resource, or be included as an Embedded Resource using cnt:Content.

It is RECOMMENDED that the document contain only a single shape element and that element SHOULD be one of: path, rect, circle, ellipse, polyline, polygon or g. The g element SHOULD ONLY be used to construct a multi-element group, for example to define a donut shape requiring an outer circle and a clipped inner circle.

The dimensions of both the shape and the SVG canvas MUST be relative to the dimensions of the Source resource. For example, given an image which is 600 pixels by 400 pixels, and the desired section is a circle of 100 pixel radius at the center of the image, then the SVG element would be: <circle cx="300" cy="200" r="100"/>

It is NOT RECOMMENDED to include style information within the SVG element, nor Javascript, animation, text or other non shape oriented information. Clients SHOULD ignore such information if present.).freeze,

    term :Tag,
      comment: %(A class assigned to the Body when it is a tag, such as a embedded text string with cnt:chars.

Tags are typically keywords or labels, and used for organization, description or discovery of the resource being tagged. In the Semantic Web, URIs are used instead of strings to avoid the issue of polysemy where one word has multiple meanings, such usage MUST be indicated using the subclass oa:SemanticTag.

Annotations that tag resources, either with text or semantic tags, SHOULD also have the oa:tagging motivation to make the reason for the Annotation more clear to applications, and MAY have other motivations as well.).freeze,

Note that OWL imports are disabled in the published version in order to reduce external implications, improve OWL 2 Profile conformity and increase interoperability. Some OWL tools might thus misleadingly show this ontology as \(re\)defining properties like skos:prefLabel.).freeze,

Open Annotations can easily be shared between platforms, with sufficient richness of expression to satisfy complex requirements while remaining simple enough to also allow for the most common use cases, such as attaching a piece of text to a single web resource.

An Annotation is considered to be a set of connected resources, typically including a body and target, where the body is somehow about the target. The full model supports additional functionality, enabling semantic annotations, embedding content, selecting segments of resources, choosing the appropriate representation of a resource and providing styling hints for consuming clients.).freeze,
